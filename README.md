## What is it?
CanUseTimer-Terminal is an open source writed in Python speedcubing
timer created to work in a terminal or command prompt window. Because 
this the program is soft and run anywhere, it means that can run in 
probally any computer with bad hardware and any operating system
(Windows, Linux and MacOS X). In future I will create a grafical
interface based in it, but I don't know a good grafical interface
Library to use in my project, but probally this will take a long
time.

## Can I help in project?
Yes, you can! I'm will verify your issue or pull request and if I like the ideia, I will implement in my software. So don't be shy to share something good.

## Install
### Stable
The stable version is the most recommended to install in your machine
because there's less bugs, have installers for all systems and you
don't need know about programing and python to run it.

**Install**

Chose your Operating system:
|System|Latest version|File|
| :- | :- | :-: |
|Windows| 0.2.1 | [CanUseTimer-v0.2.1-Windows.zip](https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer/releases/download/0.2.1/CanUseTimer-v0.2.1-Windows.zip) |
|Linux| 0.2.1.2 | [CanUseTimer-v0.2.1.2-Linux.tar.xz](https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer/releases/download/0.2.1.2/CanUseTimer-v0.2.1.2-Linux.tar.xz) |
| Mac OS | - Comming soon ||

Old Versions [here.](https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer/releases/)

### Unstable
The unstable version is a version that is in constant development
and you can see new features constantly, but this version may come
with bugs of new implementations, recommended only if you want to
check what is comming and test it.

> :warning: This type of version only have Linux installer (Because
the creator use Linux).

**Install**

To get the unstable version you only need to clone this repository
with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer.git
cd CanUseTimer
```
after this you can run it with python or (if you use Linux) install
using the file `install.sh`. To update type `git pull` and install
it again.

**Run from source**

But if you don't want to install you can run directly from source
using Python. To do this process you need install python 3.7 or higher
with pip, after install you need to install the requirements using `pip
install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

Then you can run with this command in your terminal:

	python Main.py

> :information_source: Use a Python virtual environmet, beacuse the
unstable version can make comflicts with you python libraries. to
create one type `python -m venv env` in the project folder.
