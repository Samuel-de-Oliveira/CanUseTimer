# Compile for Windows
First you need install the most recent Python version
with pip and install GNU make, we recomend use the 
[chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install
GNU Make using this follow command (as administrator):

```batchfile
choco install make
```

Then you should clone the repository using the follow command:

```batchfile
git clone https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer
```

install the required libraries for Python, go to the start of
repository and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and finally
change the directory to `Windows_Maker` and run the `make` command

and done the software is compiled :smile:
