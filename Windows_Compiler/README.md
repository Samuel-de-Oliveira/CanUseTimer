# Compile for Windows
First you need install the most recent Python version
with pip and install GNU make, we recomend use the 
[chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install
GNU Make using this follow command (as administrator):

```bat
choco install make
```

Then you should clone the repository using the follow command:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer
```

And finally change the directory to `Windows_Maker` and
run the `make` command.

and done the software is compiled at the `dist` directory :smile:
