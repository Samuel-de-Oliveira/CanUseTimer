# Compile for Windows
First you need install the most recent Python version
with Pip, then you should clone the repository using
the follow command:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer
cd .\CanUseTimer\Windows_Compiler
```

And finally change the directory to `Windows_Compiler` and
run the `make` command.

and done the software is compiled at the `dist` directory :smile:
